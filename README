NAME
    Test::NoMalware - skip all testing on Windows platform

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        use Test::NoMalware;

        ok(1, 'We have future!');

        done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
    In case of MSWin32 ` $Config{'osname'} ', skips all testing.

    Sick and tired of MSWin32 failing tests. Any software from Microsoft is
    broken by design. They are unable to make software that lasts, that
    doesn't throw away all the time and effort invested in it with the next
    release. If you have to use it, I'm sorry for you. The only way to help
    out here is to stop using Microsoft software and switch to something
    that has a future.

    It is very easy to be blinded to the essential design flaws of Microsoft
    software by the sense of achievement you get from getting it to work at
    all.
